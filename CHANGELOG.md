## Development Notes

### Known Issues
- OCR dependencies (pytesseract/easyocr) may require additional system-level installation
- Some irregular lumen shapes may still require parameter tuning
- Batch processing progress bar could be more detailed

### Testing Status
- ‚úÖ Hollow fiber detection with circular lumens
- ‚úÖ Solid filament detection
- ‚úÖ Scale bar detection (400Œºm, 500Œºm scales tested)
- üîÑ Irregular lumen shapes (recently improved)
- ‚è≥ Various magnifications and image qualities
- ‚è≥ Edge cases (partial fibers, multiple fibers per image)

### Validation Data Needed
- Ground truth measurements for accuracy validation
- Multiple magnifications for scale detection robustness
- Various image qualities (different contrast, noise levels)
- Edge cases: partially visible fibers, multiple fibers per image
