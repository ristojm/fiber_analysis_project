SEM FIBER ANALYSIS - CONVERSATION HANDOFF
===============================================

QUICK CONTEXT FOR NEW CLAUDE SESSION:
-------------------------------------

PROJECT: Modular Python system for analyzing SEM images of hollow fibers vs filaments
STATUS: Phase 1 complete, fixing hollow fiber misclassification issue
USER: Has JPG images, successfully installed system, needs testing of updated detection

IMMEDIATE TASK:
--------------
Test updated fiber_type_detection.py on user's hollow fiber image that was misclassified as filament.

CRITICAL FILES TO DOWNLOAD:
--------------------------
1. modules/image_preprocessing.py
2. modules/fiber_type_detection.py (UPDATED - enhanced lumen detection)
3. modules/scale_detection.py  
4. modules/__init__.py
5. fiber_analysis_main.py
6. requirements.txt
7. setup.py
8. README.md
9. CHANGELOG.md
10. DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md
11. .gitignore

KEY CHANGES MADE:
----------------
- Enhanced lumen detection for irregular shapes
- Relaxed parameters: area_ratio 0.05→0.02, circularity 0.4→0.15
- Multi-threshold approach for better lumen detection
- Fixed CONFIG to use input_directory properly

USER SETUP:
----------
- Project installed with: pip install -e .
- Images in sample_images/ folder (JPG format)
- One hollow fiber image misclassified as filament

GITHUB REPOSITORY:
-----------------
Project should be uploaded to GitHub for easy access:
Repository name: sem-fiber-analysis
All files included with proper documentation

NEXT STEPS:
----------
1. Test updated detection on user's hollow fiber
2. Implement porosity analysis (Phase 2A)
3. Continue iterative development approach

CONVERSATION STARTER:
-------------------
"I'm continuing development of our SEM fiber analysis system. We built a modular Python system and fixed a misclassification issue where a hollow fiber was detected as a filament. Here's the GitHub repo: [repo-url] - please review the DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md for full context and help me test the updated detection algorithm."

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
-----------------
- Multi-threshold lumen detection (15th & 35th percentile)
- Relaxed geometric constraints for irregular lumens
- Enhanced morphological operations
- Better confidence scoring

PROJECT PHASES:
--------------
Phase 1: ✅ Fiber type detection + scale calibration (COMPLETE)
Phase 2A: ⏳ Porosity analysis (ready to implement)
Phase 2B: ⏳ Texture analysis (awaiting crumbly samples)
Phase 3: ⏳ Defect detection (awaiting defect samples)
